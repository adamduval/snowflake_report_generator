# ðŸ“Š Snowflake Automated PDF Report Generator using Snowflake Notesbooks ðŸ“Š

This is a quick proof of concept project to test out the functionality of Snowflake Notebooks. The goal was to limit myself to the main notebook functionality of the Snowflake Notebook envinronment as a way to learn. The idea was to create a scheduled dynamic report for a finctional business called WidgetCo. The end product is a daily automated report which sends a PDF report of daily sales to 3 different manages in the company all using the same report format but dynamically generating the data for each Manager and products A, B and C.
