# üìä Snowflake Automated PDF Report Generator üìä

The **Snowflake Automated PDF Report Generator** is a **proof-of-concept project** designed to showcase the **functionality** and **power** of **Snowflake Notebooks**. This project demonstrates how to create a fully **automated reporting pipeline** for a fictional company, **WidgetCo**, using only **Snowflake Notebook features**.

The result? A **dynamic, daily PDF report** of **sales performance** for three product lines (**A, B, and C**), personalized for three different managers. These reports are sent automatically via **email** with **failure altering** and **archived for future reference**.
