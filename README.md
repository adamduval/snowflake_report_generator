# üìä Snowflake Automated PDF Report Generator üìä

The **Snowflake Automated PDF Report Generator** is a proof-of-concept project designed to showcase the functionality and power of Snowflake Notebooks. This project demonstrates how to create a fully automated reporting pipeline for a fictional company, WidgetCo, using only Snowflake Notebook features.

The result? A dynamic, daily PDF report of sales performance for three product lines (A, B, and C), personalized for three different managers. These reports are sent automatically via email and archived for future reference.
